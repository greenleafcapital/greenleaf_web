<p>On October 19, 2018 our Gold ETF options expired out of the money and as a result we lost our premium which was our maximum loss on the trade.</p>
<p>We entered the trade on August 6, 2018 and chose October as our expiration month. When we entered the trade, GLD was trading around $114 and today is it around $116.</p>
<p>Even though the price of GLD is above its price on August 6th, it is not high enough to be profitable.</p>
<p>We learned a few things from this trade:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had an aggressive expectation, GLD needed to rally 5% in two months.</li>
<li>The emerging currency sell-off and dollar rally caused the Gold prices to be subdued for 2 months, it seems to have bottomed now.</li>
<li>In hindsight, December would have been a better expiration for our trade.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again this was a low risk high returns trade, and it did not work out this time. We will post new trade ideas as we see them.</p>
