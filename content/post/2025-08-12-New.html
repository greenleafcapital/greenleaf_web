description: "A New Portfolio to track trading ideas."

<p>A little more than a week ago on August 1, 2025, I started a new simulated (paper money) portfolio on thinorswim. I wanted to get a feeling of managing large sums of money. My idea in doing so was to train my mind with the large swings (absolute dollars) in the portfolio value. But these swings would be minor in percentage terms of the overall portfolio.</p>
<p>The starting portfolio value is one billion dollars. The rules of managing the portfolio are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invest the entire portfolio in T Bills.</li>
<li>Use leverage to make trades. Short selling is allowed.</li>
<li>Use any instruments or asset classes to source and express ideas.</li>
<li>Max risk on any single trade will be 5 basis points.</li>
<li>Always have a STOP LOSS on every position.</li>
<li>Let the winners run, close the losers without exceptions.</li>
<li>If some stocks start to trend, look to add more (remember Livermore and Darvas).</li>
<li>Publish weekly commentary on what I leaned that week.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am aware that this exercise with pretend money is not the same as trading with real money. Indeed I remember the following excerpt from Reminiscences of the Stock Operator where Jesse Livermore narrates the stories of ghost gamblers.</p>
<p>“I have heard of people who amuse themselves conducting imaginary
operations in the stock market to prove with imaginary dollars how
right they are. Sometimes these ghost gamblers make millions. It is
very easy to be a plunger that way. It is like the old story of the man
who was going to fight a duel the next day.”</p>
<p>His second asked him, “Are you a good shot?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said the duelist, “I can snap the stem of a wineglass at twenty
paces,” and he looked modest.</p>
<p>“That’s all very well,” said the unimpressed second. “But can you snap
the stem of the wineglass while the wineglass is pointing a loaded
pistol straight at your heart?”</p>
<p>While Jesse is right and there is no denying that, it is also true that nobody start running at birth. At first you crawl, then walk and then run. So I don’t want to let perfection be the enemy of good.</p>
<p>This exercise is to train my mind to follow the “realistic” rules and take the trades. Its another thing if I use this billion dollars and bet it all on a crypto currency and turn it into 10 billion in a few weeks. That would be unrealistic and indeed something a ghost gambler would do.</p>
<p>But the rules I have for the portfolio, I believe are realistic and will stop me from making unrealistic gains from this exercise. I also acknowledge that my order fills will not be the same if I were trading with real money. In order to compensate for that I will penalize the end of the year portfolio returns by a few percentage points. Should it be 1% or 3%? I don’t know the answer to that. But that range seems reasonable.</p>
<p>Again I don’t want to let perfection be the enemy of the good and I want to keep the big picture ahead of me. I am doing this to</p>
<ul>
<li>To train my mind and get used to large dollar swings in the portfolio</li>
<li>To follow the rules I have specified above</li>
<li>To train my mind to trade without fear or hesitation</li>
<li>To cultivate good trading habits of following stop losses, journaling and reflecting on wins and losses.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the trades made in this account will be posted on github. Here I will upload the account statements, daily journal, and daily returns. The github timestamp on commits and the commit history will help us track the progress made and ensure that no historical data was changed while managing the portfolio.</p>
<p>The daily journal of trade will help me keep track of my own thinking and evolution throughout the trading day.</p>

<p>I have already started trading this account for a week and I will continue update the commentary going forward.</p>
