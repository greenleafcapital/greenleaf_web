<p>A potential trade idea that we executed today was being long Gold. First lets see how the shiny object has performed since 2010 versus the dollar.</p>
<p>Its clear from the chart that both assets move in opposite directions (most of the time). After the huge run in price in Gold from 2009 t0 2013, it saw a crash in 2014. Since then its been sideways and range bound trading between $1300 to $1200.</p>
<p>Since April 2018 gold has seen it price go down about 12% and in the same period dollar has rallied about 8%.</p>
<p>This move has largely coincided with President Trumpâ€™s escalations of trade war with Europe and China. Since the escalation the dollar has seen a run up in price, which is opposite of what the president may have intented.</p>
<p>We see this as a good trading opportunity to go long the Gold Etf via options. Below you can see the current call options chain.</p>
<p>For our trade we are going</p>
<ul>
<li>Long GLD 120 strike call options at $0.65</li>
<li>Short GLD 121 strike call options at $0.51</li>
</ul>
<p>Our max loss on the trade is $0.14 and max profit is $0.86. This trade will expire in 74 days and we may re-adjust or close it before.</p>
<p>We think that GLD has a good chance of bouncing upto $117 in the next few weeks. If that happens we may start seeing some profit on this trade. We will update this post when we make any changes.</p>
