<p>We can see from the chart that Netflix had formed a support around 330 to 340 price range. This support was breached after the earnings disappointment on July 17th. Since then the stock has recovered back from $300 to $330 which was its last trading price when this post was written.</p>
<p>We might expect the previous support area to act as resistance. Currently Netflix is trading near this resistance area. Also the 200 Day moving average price is aroound $335. These two can act as a major resistance area.</p>
<p>So how can we trade this stock?</p>
<p>Shorting Netflix outright has been disastrous over the past several years and it is not a good idea to short Netflix without any hedging strategy.</p>
<p>The best way in our opinion is to use Netflixâ€™s put options, and since we want to give this trade some time to workout, we are looking at the options expiring in December.</p>
<p>Below you can see partial December option chain.</p>

<p>Our target price for Netflix is to trade somewhere between 280 to 260. So we like the 280/265 put vertical. You will have to pay somewhere around $3 to buy this vertical. The max profit on this trade (assuming $3 to buy it) is $12 and the max loss is the price we pay to buy this vertical which is $3.</p>
<div id="summary" class="section level4">
<h4>Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>Netflix has disappointed after its earnings</li>
<li>Subscribers growth has slowed</li>
<li>Stock is trading near the 200 Day moving average and the previous support area. These could act as potential resistance.</li>
<li>We want to enter into an asymmetric risk/reward trade, to control our risk and maximize our profits</li>
<li>Buying the 280/265 December 2019 put vertical is one of the many ways to capitalize on this trade</li>
<li>The put vertical will cost $3</li>
<li>Max gain is $12</li>
<li>Max loss is $3</li>
</ul>
