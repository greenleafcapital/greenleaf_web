<p>All of the 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 are trading negative. Even “safe” sectors such as Utilities and Consumer Staples are negative. The worst performance was for the Energy, Materials, Industrial and Financial sectors. Those are more cyclical in nature and maybe pointing to a slowdown or a recession in the overall economy.</p>

<p>This chart may appear busy, because it packs a lot of information. This chart shows the YTD performance for each stock in the S&amp;P 500 index. The Y-axis is the YTD returns and X-axis shows their weight in the S&amp;P 500 index. The different colors are for different sectors. I have only named the symbols of the major stocks that most investor are familiar with.</p>
<p>Next we will zoom in to take a better look at the stocks smaller weight (less than 20bps) that outperformed this year.</p>
