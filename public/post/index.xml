      <description>In the last post we discussed the recent sell off in the US equity markets. In this post we will dig deeper and see how individual components of the market performed this year.
First we will begin by looking at the components that make up the S&amp;amp;P 500 index and the returns for 2018.

      <description>Volatility is back in the stock markets. In the past we have pointed out the divergence between the US markets and the World stock markets. It is now clear that this disconnection has now resolved itself with the sell-off in the US markets. YTD the US stock market is down about 7%. The month December 2018 saw its worst performance in since the great depression. It was at one point down almost 18%.</description>

      <description>2018 has not been a good year for equities. One sector in particular has come under enormous pressure. Home builder stocks are now firmly into bear market. In this article we will try to analyze this sector and see if there is an opportunity to invest or stay away from these stocks.
Lets begin by looking at the overall housing sector.
The sector is highly volatile and cyclical.</description>

      <description>The US stocks market are in a coorection territory now. They are down more than 10% in the last two months. One of the major sectors has been trending lower throughout 2018. The financials sector is in a bear market. The major banks around the world are looking weak. Initially investors dismissed these concerns as company specific. Goldman Sachs was tangled in the 1MDB scandal. Then there European banks such as Deutche Bank and Credit Suisse.</description>

      <description>Market Review 2018We began this year on a high note. Markets around the world rallied 7 to 8% in January. But February saw a quick 10% correction. Since then the stock markets have mostly gone sideways. But the volatility has increased a lot in the last few weeks.
Below are some reasons for the sideways market
Trade warsSince Donald Trump took control of the White House he had been eager to reduce the US trade deficits.</description>

      <description>For the third quarter of 2018 S&amp;amp;P 500 rallied almost 8.5% and was up almost 10% for 2018. But all that has changed since the beginning of Q4 2018 in October. We will begin by looking at the yearly performance of S&amp;amp;P 500 so far.
As we can see that October saw a severe fall in stock market price. We lost almost 10% and wiped off all the gains for the year.</description>

      <description>It was lottery fever in America and the recent Mega Million lottery jackpot grew to almost $1.6 billion. Its the largest jackpot in the lottery’s history. The winning numbers were drawn yesterday, and the winner is from North Carolina. We may not know who the winner is since North Carolina’s law allows lottery winners to stay anonymous.
The number $1.6 billion may sound a lot (and it is), after all this person(s), will be 1477th richest in the world according to Forbes ranking.</description>

      <description>On October 19, 2018 our Gold ETF options expired out of the money and as a result we lost our premium which was our maximum loss on the trade.
We entered the trade on August 6, 2018 and chose October as our expiration month. When we entered the trade, GLD was trading around $114 and today is it around $116.
Even though the price of GLD is above its price on August 6th, it is not high enough to be profitable.</description>

      <description>On September 15, 2008 investment bank Lehman Brothers announced bankruptcy. This event was the largest bankruptcy in US history and pushed the world economies in deep recessions. Today is the 10 year anniversary of this event. We wanted to reflect back on this event and see how the markets have performed since the bankruptcy in 2008.
It was a tough time for investors and many panicked and sold their stock holdings.</description>

      <guid>/post/2018-08-17-sp500_analysis/</guid>
      <description>How has S&amp;amp;P 500 performed so far in 2018. We can start by looking at the S&amp;amp;P 500 chart below.
We can see from the chart that the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up about 6.5% since January. The price action in this chart has been sideways. We are stuck in a range 250 and 285. After big gains in 2017 the market seems to be consolidating at these new all time highs.</description>

      <description>The Turkish currency depreciation which was a slow moving event for the past two years is now front and center in the financial world. The relations between US and Turkey have been deteriorating and Turkey which is a NATO member is looking for new friends. In light of all this our long gold trade has been performing poorly. We put on that trade last Monday (August 6) and since then Gold prices have fallen 2.</description>

      <description>Turkey Currency crisisThe emerging markets are spiraled into chaos and crisis and leading the way is Turkey. The country has been tackling one crisis after another. In 2016 the there was an attempt of military coup which was put down by the people of Turkey. Since then the current president of Turkey Erdogan has consolidated his hold at the top. He has purged many opponents and the recent elections has emboldened his hold at the top.</description>

      <description>Today we executed a trade to sell both call and put verticals on the underlying TLT etf (Long US government bonds etf). For the trade to make money, both legs of the trade need to expire worthless. First lets start by looking at the historical returns and volatility of Long Bonds since summer of 2016.
Interest rates made their lows in the summer of 2016 and since then rates have been moving higher.</description>

      <title>Gold Trade Idea</title>

      <guid>/post/gld/</guid>
      <description>A potential trade idea that we executed today was being long Gold. First lets see how the shiny object has performed since 2010 versus the dollar.
Its clear from the chart that both assets move in opposite directions (most of the time). After the huge run in price in Gold from 2009 t0 2013, it saw a crash in 2014. Since then its been sideways and range bound trading between $1300 to $1200.</description>

      <description>FAANG stock performance since July 1, 2018
With Netflix and Facebook both suffering major losses, all eyes will be on Apple as it races to be the first company with a $1 Trillion valuation.
How have the FAANG stocks performed YTD
Netflix and Amazon have clearly dominated the large cap stocks. This has been a terrible year of performance for managers who make a living by shorting “bubble basket stocks”.</description>

      <description>Year 2018 has not been a good one for the bond investors. Since the summer of 2017, interest rates have been rising.
The long term interest rates had been trending lower since 1980s. In the chart above rates reached a high of 8% and since then they kept making lower lows. Currently the ten year rates are near the an important key level at 3%. From here the future path interest will decide which way the trend moves.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Facebook reported their earnings after market hours and investors were not pleased. They sent the stock down almost 25% at one point. Right now the stock is down about 20%. We wanted to check if this was the worst performance for Facebook stock since the IPO
This is the worst one day performance for Facebook since its IPO. After its IPO Facebook stock was under heavy pressure and it continued to slide down for several days.</description>

      <description>How do interest rates affect Market Valuations?It has been said many times that it is impossible to predict a bear market. Many on Wall Street spend enormous amount of time and money on this very activity. Although it may be difficult to predict the bear market one can evaluate the conditions that could lead to a bear market. What do I mean by that?
Lets imagine a bridge that carries thousands of vehicles across from one end to another.</description>
