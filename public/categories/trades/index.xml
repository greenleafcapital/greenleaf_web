      <description>&lt;p&gt;On October 19, 2018 our Gold ETF options expired out of the money and as a result we lost our premium which was our maximum loss on the trade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We entered the trade on August 6, 2018 and chose October as our expiration month. When we entered the trade, GLD was trading around $114 and today is it around $116.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though the price of GLD is above its price on August 6th, it is not high enough to be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;script src=&#34;//localhost:4321/rmarkdown-libs/kePrint/kePrint.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Facebook reported their earnings after market hours and investors were not pleased. They sent the stock down almost 25% at one point. Right now the stock is down about 20%. We wanted to check if this was the worst performance for Facebook stock since the IPO&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:4321/post/2018-07-26-facebook-idea_files/figure-html/daily%20charts-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the worst one day performance for Facebook since its IPO. After its IPO Facebook stock was under heavy pressure and it continued to slide down for several days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
