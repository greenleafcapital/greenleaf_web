      <description>A potential trade idea that we executed today was being long Gold. First lets see how the shiny object has performed since 2010 versus the dollar.
price_data %&amp;gt;% group_by(symbol) %&amp;gt;% tq_transmute(select = adjusted, mutate_fun = periodReturn, period = &amp;quot;yearly&amp;quot;, col_rename = &amp;quot;returns&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% ungroup() %&amp;gt;% mutate(symbol = if_else(symbol == &amp;quot;GLD&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Gold&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dollar&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = returns, fill = symbol)) + geom_bar(stat = &amp;#39;identity&amp;#39;, position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;) + ggtitle(&amp;quot;Gold versus Dollar annual performance since 2010&amp;quot;) + labs(x = &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Annual Returns&amp;quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + theme_bw() + scale_fill_discrete(name = &amp;quot;Asset&amp;quot;) Its clear from the chart that both assets move in opposite directions (most of the time).</description>

      <description>Yesterday Facebook reported their earnings after market hours and investors were not pleased. They sent the stock down almost 25% at one point. Right now the stock is down about 20%. We wanted to check if this was the worst performance for Facebook stock since the IPO
This is the worst one day performance for Facebook since its IPO. After its IPO Facebook stock was under heavy pressure and it continued to slide down for several days.</description>
