      <description>For the third quarter of 2018 S&amp;amp;P 500 rallied almost 8.5% and was up almost 10% for 2018. But all that has changed since the beginning of Q4 2018 in October. We will begin by looking at the yearly performance of S&amp;amp;P 500 so far.
As we can see that October saw a severe fall in stock market price. We lost almost 10% and wiped off all the gains for the year.</description>

      <description>How has S&amp;amp;P 500 performed so far in 2018. We can start by looking at the S&amp;amp;P 500 chart below.
We can see from the chart that the S&amp;amp;P 500 is up about 6.5% since January. The price action in this chart has been sideways. We are stuck in a range 250 and 285. After big gains in 2017 the market seems to be consolidating at these new all time highs.</description>
