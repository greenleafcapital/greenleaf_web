<h1>Our Current Portfolios</h1>
<p>Starting this quarter we will publish the the list of our portfolios where we are investing our money. These portfolios are constructed for investors with different levels of risks and return objectives. We have initially invested $10 million in each portfolio and we will monitor the progress as we go along. These portfolios were constructed on October 3rd 2018 and the purchase prices are from that day. We won’t worry too much about the intraday movement of stock, but we will update the prices and performance of the portfolios on a timely basis.</p>
<div id="stocks-from-the-dow-jones-index" class="section level2">
<h2>Stocks from the Dow Jones Index</h2>
<p>The first portfolio is built by investing in the best stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The relevant benchmark for this portfolio is DJIA, and we expect this portfolio to beat the index over the long term market cycle. At times the markets experience severe bear markets, when such an event occurs we may move the money into the safety of cash or bonds.</p>

<h2>Stocks from the S&amp;P 500 Index</h2>
<p>The second portfolio is built by investing in the best stocks from the S&amp;P 500. The relevant benchmark for this portfolio is SPX 500, and we expect this portfolio to beat the index over the long term market cycle. We will follow the same rule as above during the bear markets. This portfolio invests in 50 stocks and may offer better diversification for investors who prefer that.</p>
